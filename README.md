# ⚛️ React Complete Guide

A complete, **hands-on** React learning guide from **basics to advanced**.  
Perfect for mastering React fundamentals, building real apps, and reviewing advanced concepts with speed.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside?

This repository is a **structured React roadmap**, ideal for:

- ✅ Learning components, JSX, props, and hooks step by step  
- 🧠 Understanding React's internal logic (state, effects, context)  
- 🚀 Building scalable apps with routing, performance, testing & deployment

Each topic includes:

> 📘 `README.md` — covers theory and walkthroughs  
> 💻 `.jsx` / `.js` — component-based code samples, runnable with minimal setup  
> 🌐 Optional `index.html` — only for basic HTML/JSX experiments when needed
